				CatchOne: (捕获 {0} {1})
				CatchMultiple: (捕获 {2} {0} {1})
				2354: Those glowing fish in the mushroom biome are really attractive to other fish. If you bring me one, I might share some of the resulting concoction
				2356: I'm curious about whats inside those little boxes you sea floating out in the water. Bring me one and I'll give you something to help with finding even more of them
				2355: Those bats underground are really great at sensing their surroundings without being able to see. Maybe if you bring me a similar fish, we'll be able to sense what's under the water!
				2428: I want another one of those bunny fish pets! Bring me one and I'll get you your own pet bunny!
				2368: You wanna get your hands on the same fishing gear as me, eh? Prove you're worth it and catch one of the fastest fish in the sea!
				5139: You need one of those fancy bobbers? Ill give it to you if you bring me some lunch!
				2373: Want your line to never break? Gimme something to test these lines on, and I'll give you the one that doesn't break.
				2374: You're gonna need another trinket to really get in the mood of angling. Get me some of those fatty jungle fish and I'll work on a replica for you.
				2375: Those cods with two heads have the mysterious ability to make things you use not get used. Bring me some and I'll get you a special tackle box with the same ability.
				3120: I need a new night light! Get me a glowy fish and I'll reward you with something to keep track of your skill.
				3037: Get me some of those fish from that cold place and I'll give you that radio, I guess
				3096: Those fish from the sky are really good at calming you down when cooked into a stew, and I need more! bring me them and I'll give you the telescope I usually use for finding those sky lakes.
				2360: This useless thing? sure, I'll hand it over for uuuh... some of those weird underground fish.
				4067: Yes! The fish cart is the best cart! I'll get you a brand new cart for the small price of a Rockfish!

				2294: You want my favorite rod too? Ok fine, but only if you make me even richer!
				2422: This beauty is great for fishing up a pre-cooked meal. I'll let you have it for an exotic lava fish!
				3032: Those sponges are hard to craft, you know? I'll get you one if you get me some essential materials.
				3031: Ah, the perfect tool for making your own pond, anywhere you want. I can get you one but I'm gonna need a lot more water.
				5303: Need to clean up that pesky sticky stuff? Bring me one of those fish known for making it and I'll get you the tool for getting rid of it.
				5302: How much of this honey stuff do you need?? Well, get me those super sweet fish that dwell in it and I'll get you your tool.
				2494: And now you want to fly like the fish? I'm gonna need some souls of flying fish for that one.
				HellfireBait: Using explosives to get several catches at once sure is satisfying, but this stuff is rare. I can only afford to give you a few in exchange for some fiery catches.
